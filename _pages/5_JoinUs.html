  <h3 class="section-title">Post-doctoral fellows</h3>
  <p class="lead">Applications are invited from exceptional candidates with a PhD degree in research topics related to Data Science, Artificial Intelligence or Allied Application Domains (see here: <a href="https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/research">https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/research#rs-topic-projects</a>). The research fellowship will include a monthly stipend that is significantly higher than typical institute post-doc fellowship, hence may be considered as an exceptional fellowship for exceptional candidates.</p> <p class="lead"> (1) In the first round, candidates selected based on their application package, are offered a Research Associate position for a maximum period of 3 months. The selected candidates use this time to develop close research interactions with a faculty mentor of mutual interest, refine their research proposal, and generate preliminary results.</p><p class="lead">(2) In the second round that could be scheduled within 3 months from joining, Research Associates must appear for an RBC DSAI Fellowship Interview. Upon clearing the fellowship interview,  the applicant is declared an "RBC DSAI Research Fellow" that offers an attractive monthly stipend, additional allowances for research/travel, etc.</p><p class="lead">For a candidate to maximize chances of getting the RBC DSAI Research Fellowship, in the 3 months before appearing for the RBC DSAI interviews, the candidate should closely interact with his/her faculty guide and get the faculty to write a strong support letter to make the case for approving the applicant's RBC DSAI fellowship.</p><p class="lead">To apply for the RBC DSAI Research Fellowship program please <a href="https://forms.gle/bZhs9awsxTkgWZnN8">click here</a>.</p><p class="lead"><strong>Please note:</strong> IITM Ph.D. scholars are not encouraged to apply. However, outstanding candidates on merit can apply in exceptional cases to work with faculty in a department different from his/her parent department. In this case, continuation with the same guide(s) is not allowed.<a href="https://rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in/about">About RBCDSAI</a></p>
