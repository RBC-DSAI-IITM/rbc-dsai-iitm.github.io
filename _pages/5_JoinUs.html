The selected candidates use this time to develop close research interactions with a faculty mentor of mutual interest, refine their research proposal, and generate preliminary results.</p><p class="lead">(2) In the second round that could be scheduled within 3 months from joining, Research Associates must appear for an RBC DSAI Fellowship Interview. Upon clearing the fellowship interview,  the applicant is declared an "RBC DSAI Research Fellow" that offers an attractive monthly stipend, additional allowances for research/travel, etc.</p><p class="lead">For a candidate to maximize chances of getting the RBC DSAI Research Fellowship, in the 3 months before appearing for the RBC DSAI interviews, the candidate should closely interact with his/her faculty guide and get the faculty to write a strong support letter to make the case for approving the applicant's RBC DSAI fellowship.</p><p class="lead">To apply for the RBC DSAI Research Fellowship program please <a href="https://forms.gle/bZhs9awsxTkgWZnN8">click here</a>.</p><p class="lead"><strong>Please note:</strong> IITM Ph.D. scholars are not encouraged to apply.
