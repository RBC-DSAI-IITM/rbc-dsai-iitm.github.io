    <p class="lead ">
      The Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC-DSAI) was founded in August 2017,
      with a vision to expand and further the research, education and outreach activities of the erstwhile 
      Interdisciplinary Laboratory for Data Science at IIT Madras.
     </p> 
     <p class="lead">
      RBC-DSAI comprises faculty from several departments
      across the Institute, who carry out research in various areas of data science and artificial intelligence. The long-term
      vision of RBC-DSAI is to become a world leader in data science research, where long-standing fundamental research problems,
      cutting across disciplines, are targeted and solved.

  <h2 class="subtitle mb-4">Strengths</h2>
  <p class="mb-5">
  The RBC-DSAI is one of the few centres in the world for data science and AI applications in various engineering disciplines. 

  With the increased availability of data from online social media, transactions and sensors increasingly AI is focusing on networked data or relational data. We have one of the largest groups in the country looking at networked data across different disciplines – biology, transportation, water distribution, process modeling, online social media, telecom, and reaction networks.


   Deep Reinforcement Learning is at the cutting edge of the new AI revolution and is responsible for the many path-breaking developments in AI recently. The Centre has the largest Deep Reinforcement Learning group in India and one of the largest in academia in the world.
