    <p class="lead ">
      The Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (RBC-DSAI) was founded in
      August 2017, in IIT Madras with a vision to expand and further the research, education and outreach
      activities in the areas of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
     </p> 
     <p class="lead">
      RBC-DSAI comprises faculty from several departments across the Institute, who carry out research in
      various areas of data science and artificial intelligence. The long-term vision of RBC-DSAI is to
      become a world leader in data science research, where long-standing fundamental research
      problems, cutting across disciplines, are targeted and solved.

  <h2 class="subtitle mb-4">Strengths</h2>
<h4><li>The RBC-DSAI is one of the few centres in the world for data science and AI applications in various
engineering disciplines.</li></h4>
<h4><li>With the increased availability of data from online social media, transactions and sensors
increasingly AI is focusing on networked data or relational data. We have one of the largest groups in

rbc-dsai.iitm.ac.in
the country looking at networked data across different disciplines – biology, transportation, water
distribution, process modeling, online social media, telecom, and reaction networks.</li></h4><h4><li>TDeep Reinforcement Learning is at the cutting edge of the new AI revolution and is responsible for
the many path-breaking developments in AI recently. The Centre has the largest Deep
Reinforcement Learning group in India and one of the largest in academia in the world.</li></h4>
