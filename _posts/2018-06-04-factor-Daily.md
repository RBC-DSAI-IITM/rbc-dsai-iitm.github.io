einforcement learning is a pretty complex topic to wrap your head around, as far as intellectual pursuits go. It’s also one of the hottest areas of AI research: MIT Technology Review picked it as one of the top 10 technologies of 2017. Reinforcement learning chalked up one of the flashiest wins for AI this decade in March 2016, when DeepMind AlphaGo beat world championship player Lee Sedol at the game Go. Sedol, after his 4-1 loss to AlphaGo said that it felt like he was playing against an alien intelligence. Many AI researchers consider reinforcement learning, or RL in short,  to be the path that will help humanity scale its highest summit: artificial general intelligence. (Park away in your mind artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for later in this story.) No wonder then, that it’s on a league of its own, in terms of ambition and hype.

In a quest to demystify this tremendously arcane area of AI research, FactorDaily spoke to Professor Balaraman Ravindran, an IIT Madras professor, who is widely considered to be India’s foremost reinforcement learning expert. Based on a previous data story at FactorDaily in which we attempted to map out the country’s leading machine learning researchers, this assessment rings true. In any case, we wanted to ask him if he would be okay to be referred to as such.

“That I agree, because I am the only one,” he says, laughing. “That was said half jokingly, but I have been working on RL (reinforcement learning) since I came back (from the US)… even before that,” he says. Ravindran did his Ph.D. research at University of Massachusetts, Amherst, mentored by Prof. Andrew G. Barto, a founding father of RL.
