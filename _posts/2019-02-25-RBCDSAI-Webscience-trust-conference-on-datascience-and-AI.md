AI technologies have long been used by Web developers and the major platforms to provide increasingly intelligent services for Web and internet users, and it was always part of Tim Berners-Lee’s original design to develop an intelligent, or semantic, Web that enabled machines to infer knowledge from interconnected documents and data. Web Science studies the evolution of the Web from a sociotechnical perspective and how human intelligence interacts with the artificial intelligence we derive from our use of the Web.</p><p align="justify">Artificial Intelligence is set to transform society in the coming decades in ways that have long been predicted by science fiction writers but are only now becoming feasible because of recent developments in computing technology, machine learning and the availability of massive amounts of data on which to train the algorithms. The potential is enormous and governments around the world are worrying about the impact of AI on society both in terms of how it will change the world of work, but also in terms of the potential advantages that the technology can bring to society. But we must also be very aware of the potential threats to society that such developments might bring and the ethical, accountability and diversity issues we need to address, including particularly the world of software automation. If we don’t lay the groundwork well now, there is huge potential for chaos and confusion in the future as AI starts to become more dominant in all our lives, which is why I argue we need to take a socio-technical approach to every aspect of the evolution of AI in society as we have for the study of the Web.</p><p align="justify">But as a result of all these developments we are facing a time of major change and disruption for the internet – the technology that has underpinned so much societal change over the last fifty years. In this talk we will argue that we must take a sociotechnical approach to our analysis of the evolution of the internet in order to ensure that the internet of the future helps us create a world that we all want to live in.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><p>10:15 AM - 10:45 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=srinathsrinivasa">Srinath Srinivasa</a>, IIIT Bangalore</p><table style="width:100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><details><p><summary><strong>Title:</strong><u>Characterising online social cognition</u></summary></p><p align="justify">Social cognition refers to processes by which one or more collective worldviews emerge across populations as a result of social interactions. Online social cognition based on the dynamics of social media is increasingly playing a central role in business, politics, governance, and even in shaping our personal lives. There has been a dearth of computational models of social cognition, that has impeded deeper analysis of this phenomenon. In this work, we propose a model for online social cognition. A social discourse is defined as the set of all activities, opinions and actors involved in social interaction around a topic. A discourse is modelled as a "marketplace of opinions", where parties invest opinions to get different kinds of returns-- be they sales, or votes or likes. An opinion in turn is modelled as a combination of an abstractive and an expressive component, each of which have different psychological impacts on participants. A notion of compatibility of opinions is then introduced, and clusters of compatible opinions form the different narratives, driving the discourse. We then characterise each narrative by its salient opinions, and identify two classes of participants for each narrative: opinion drivers and narrative drivers. The social discourse itself is then modelled as an interaction graph of narratives. Interactions between narratives are identified as either compatible or conflicting, based on the sentiment in the inter narrative conversations. This then brings us a concept of stability of the discourse, based on the Cartwright-Harary theorem of social networks. A discourse is said to be active as long as it is unstable, and has the potential for different forms of social impact. A stable discourse on the other hand, would have settled down into different camps.</p><p align="justify"><strong>About the speaker:</strong> Srinath Srinivasa heads the Web Science lab and is the Dean (Research and Development) at IIIT Bangalore, India.

The key to study such interactions, in his understanding, is not the individual and his psychology, but “the syntactical relations among the acts of different persons mutually present to one another” (Goffman 1967, Interaction Ritual, pp. 2 as cited in Schegloff 1988 pp. 94). Accordingly, this framework has been applied in the analysis of human-human interactions on online platforms (e.g., Hogan, 2010; Bullingham & Vasconcelos, 2013) and in the analysis of human-machine interactions (e.g., Bucher, 2014; Lee, Frank, Beute, de Kort., & IJsselsteijn, 2017). We extend Goffman dramaturgical framework to analyse the interactions that take place between humans and conversational agents such as Alexa, Google Echo and so on. We see these assistants as performative agents engaging in social interactions with their human counterparts where in the “backstage” of both human and non-human remain inaccessible (Latour 1996). We ask, what are the different types of strategies the voice assistants can employ for "impression management"? How can we analyze these strategies without having access to the "backstage"? How do the conversational agents maintain decorum of expected behavior? With this analytical approach, we aim to understand to what extent sustained “natural” conversations may take place between humans and  conversational agents.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><p>11:45 AM - 12:15 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="http://talukdar.net/">Partha Talukdar</a>, IISc</p><table style="width:100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><details><p><summary><strong>Title:</strong><u>Learning with Graph Embeddings</u></summary></p><p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong>In this talk, I shall present an overview of our recent research in learning with graph embeddings,in particular using Graph Convolution Networks.

We also observe that the set of winners, as well as, that of the “serious candidates” (contenders) have asset distributions which deviate significantly from those of the remaining candidates.

Therefore, to help the users, all major online organizations deploy information retrieval (content recommendation, search or ranking) systems to find important information. Current information retrieval systems have to make certain design choices. For example, news recommendation systems need to decide on the quality of recommended news stories, how much emphasis to give to a story’s long-term importance over its recency or freshness etc. Similarly, retrieval systems over user generated contents (e.g., in social media like Facebook and Twitter) need to take into account the content posted by heterogeneous user groups. However, such design choices can introduce unintended biases in the contents presented to the users. For example, the recommended contents may have poor quality or less news value, or the news discourse may get hijacked by hyper-active demographic groups. In this work, we want to systematically measure the effect of such design choices in the retrieval systems (recommendation systems in particular), and build alternate retrieval systems that mitigate the biases in the recommendation output.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table><li><p>10:45 AM - 11:15 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea Break</p></li><li><p>11:15 AM - 11:45 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/">Animesh Mukherjee</a>, IIT KGP</p><table style="width:100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><details><p><summary><strong>Title:</strong><u>Language dynamics in social media</u></summary></p><p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong>In this talk I shall outline a summary of our five year long initiative studying the temporal dynamics of various human language-like entities over the social media.

They need to employ relational analytics, which examines data on how people interact, to identify “high potentials,” who has good ideas, who is influential, what teams will get work done on time, and more.Companies can mine their “digital exhaust”—data created by employees every day in their digital transactions, such as e‐mails, chats, “likes,” “follows,”  @mentions, and file collaboration—for insights into their workforce. Drawing from our prior research and consulting work with companies, as well as from a large body of other scholars research, we identify six structural signatures that should form the bedrock of any relational analytics strategy to help companies address challenges they face with issues such as diversity and inclusion, succession planning, team assembly, and post-merger integration.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><p>02:45 PM - 03:15 PM   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/">Mitesh Khapra</a>, IITM</p></li><li><p>03:15 PM - 04:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panel Discussion: <strong>Fostering Web Science Community in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; India</strong></p></li><li><p>04:00 PM - 05:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High Tea and Closing</p></li></ul>';

The origins of the Web Science Trust can be found in the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) which was established in 2006. Now in 2018, we have assembled 20 world-class international research groups, founded a Summer School which is held in a different location each year, and run a series of international teaching and research events including an ACM Web Science conference now in its 11th year.</p><br><br><h4><strong>First RBCDSAI Web Science Symposium </strong></h4><br><h5>Date: <strong>February 25, 2019 - February 26, 2019 </strong></h5><br>Venue: <strong>ICSR Auditorium, IIT Madras</strong></div>
