AI technologies have long been used by Web developers and the major platforms to provide increasingly intelligent services for Web and internet users, and it was always part of Tim Berners-Lee’s original design to develop an intelligent, or semantic, Web that enabled machines to infer knowledge from interconnected documents and data. Web Science studies the evolution of the Web from a sociotechnical perspective and how human intelligence interacts with the artificial intelligence we derive from our use of the Web.</p><p align="justify">Artificial Intelligence is set to transform society in the coming decades in ways that have long been predicted by science fiction writers but are only now becoming feasible because of recent developments in computing technology, machine learning and the availability of massive amounts of data on which to train the algorithms. The potential is enormous and governments around the world are worrying about the impact of AI on society both in terms of how it will change the world of work, but also in terms of the potential advantages that the technology can bring to society. But we must also be very aware of the potential threats to society that such developments might bring and the ethical, accountability and diversity issues we need to address, including particularly the world of software automation. If we don’t lay the groundwork well now, there is huge potential for chaos and confusion in the future as AI starts to become more dominant in all our lives, which is why I argue we need to take a socio-technical approach to every aspect of the evolution of AI in society as we have for the study of the Web.</p><p align="justify">But as a result of all these developments we are facing a time of major change and disruption for the internet – the technology that has underpinned so much societal change over the last fifty years. In this talk we will argue that we must take a sociotechnical approach to our analysis of the evolution of the internet in order to ensure that the internet of the future helps us create a world that we all want to live in.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><p>10:15 AM - 10:45 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=srinathsrinivasa">Srinath Srinivasa</a>, IIIT Bangalore</p></li><li><p>10:45 AM - 11:15 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refreshments</p></li><li><p>11:15 AM - 11:45 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="https://www.imsc.res.in/~sitabhra/">Sitabhra Sinha</a>, Institute of Mathematical Sciences (IMSc)</p><table style="width:100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><details><p><summary><strong>Title:</strong><u>How representative is our democracy ?

We also observe that the set of winners, as well as, that of the “serious candidates” (contenders) have asset distributions which deviate significantly from those of the remaining candidates. This is a worrying aspect given the supposedly representative nature of electoral democracies, particularly in light of the recent worldwide rise to power of xenophobic populism.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><p>11:45 AM - 12:15 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="http://talukdar.net/">Partha Talukdar</a>, IISc</p><table style="width:100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><details><p><summary><strong>Title:</strong><u>Learning with Graph Embeddings</u></summary></p><p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong>In this talk, I shall present an overview of our recent research in learning with graph embeddings,in particular using Graph Convolution Networks.

While there are now several algorithms to detect, analyze and control hate speech - some of them are based on deep learning methods, they suffer from looking at this problem in a limited manner. Throwing more data at a Deep Neural Network does not always solve the problem and, in fact, this approach may cause additional problems. I will discuss our recent research efforts in collaboration with social scientists come up with nuanced sexism categorization, which seem to be a very promising direction. I will also describe our work on removing the bias in hate speech detection and a novel method leveraging knowledge-based generalizations for bias-free learning of hate speech detection models. </p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><p>03:15 PM - 04:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Poster Spotlights</strong></p></li><li><p>04:00 PM - 04:30 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea Break</p></li><li><p>04:30 PM - 06:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poster Session</p></li><li><p>06:00 PM - 07:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Networking</p></li><li><p>07:00 PM - 09:00 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinner, ICSR Dining hall</p></li><br><br><li><p align="center"><u><strong>Day 2: 26th February,2019 (Tuesday)</strong></u> </p></li><li><p>09:00 AM - 09:45 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Keynote Address by </strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jprangaswami/?originalSubdomain=in">J.P.Rangaswami</a>, Univeristy of Southampton</p><table style="width:100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><details><p><summary><strong>Title:</strong><u>Why Web Science is more important than ever before</u></summary></p><p align="justify">In the talk I will explore this topic from the perspective of data over a 40-year career spanning three continents and senior positions in a number of the world’s leading companies.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><p>09:45 AM - 10:15 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="#">TBD</a></p></li><li><p>10:15 AM - 10:45 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/CS/faculty/cs-niloy">Niloy Ganguly</a>, IIT KGP</p> <table style="width:100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><details><p><summary><strong>Title:</strong><u>Some Aspects of Computational Journalism</u></summary></p><p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong>Due to the enormous amount of information being carried over online systems today, no user can access all such information. Therefore, to help the users, all major online organizations deploy information retrieval (content recommendation, search or ranking) systems to find important information. Current information retrieval systems have to make certain design choices. For example, news recommendation systems need to decide on the quality of recommended news stories, how much emphasis to give to a story’s long-term importance over its recency or freshness etc. Similarly, retrieval systems over user generated contents (e.g., in social media like Facebook and Twitter) need to take into account the content posted by heterogeneous user groups. However, such design choices can introduce unintended biases in the contents presented to the users. For example, the recommended contents may have poor quality or less news value, or the news discourse may get hijacked by hyper-active demographic groups. In this work, we want to systematically measure the effect of such design choices in the retrieval systems (recommendation systems in particular), and build alternate retrieval systems that mitigate the biases in the recommendation output.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table><li><p>10:45 AM - 11:15 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea Break</p></li><li><p>11:15 AM - 11:45 AM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~animeshm/">Animesh Mukherjee</a>, IIT KGP</p><table style="width:100%"><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><details><p><summary><strong>Title:</strong><u>Language dynamics in social media</u></summary></p><p align="justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong>In this talk I shall outline a summary of our five year long initiative studying the temporal dynamics of various human language-like entities over the social media.

They need to employ relational analytics, which examines data on how people interact, to identify “high potentials,” who has good ideas, who is influential, what teams will get work done on time, and more. Companies can mine their “digital exhaust”—data created by employees every day in their digital transactions, such as e‐mails, chats, “likes,” “follows,” @mentions, and file collaboration—for insights into their workforce. Drawing from our prior research and consulting work with companies, as well as from a large body of other scholars’ research, we identify six structural signatures that should form the bedrock of any relational analytics strategy to help companies address challenges they face with issues such as diversity and inclusion, succession planning, team assembly, and post-merger integration.</p></details></li></ul></td></tr></table></li><li><p>02:45 PM - 03:15 PM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk by <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/">B.
