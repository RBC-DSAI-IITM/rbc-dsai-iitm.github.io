<p align="justify"><strong><u>Brief Abstract</u></strong>

The workshop will deal with measurement-based real-time optimization (RTO) strategies for improving process performance in the presence of uncertainty in the form of plant-model mismatch, drifts and disturbances. RTO typically uses a plant model to compute optimal inputs.<p>

 

<p align="justify">In the presence of uncertainty, selected model parameters can be estimated and the updated model then used for optimization. Although very intuitive, this two-step approach suffers from the fact that the model is almost invariably “inadequate”, which prevents from reaching the plant optimum. Other approaches have been developed in the last two decades to overcome this difficulty. For example, in modifier adaptation, the basic idea is to leave the model parameters unchanged but to use plant measurements to “appropriately” modify the cost and constraint functions. Also, researchers have tried to turn the optimization problem into a control problem, as this is done in self-optimizing control.</p>

 

<p align="justify">We will address several important issues such as (i) what can be done off-line prior to process operation, and what should be performed in real time, (ii) how much of the optimization effort is model-based and how much is data-driven, (iii) what to measure, what to adapt, how to adapt?.</p>
