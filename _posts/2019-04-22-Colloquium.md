Indian Institute of Technology Madras Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial    (RBC DSAI) hosted a Colloquium on 'Artificial Intelligence - A Priority for India' on April 22, 2019, bringing together leading researchers, academics, policymakers and industry leaders in India to understand and deliberate on the state of research and innovation in AI and Machine Learning in the country. It also focused on arriving at actionable programmes for the Indian AI ecosystem to contribute, collaborate and co-create.

<p><br>Last month, we took Prof. Balaraman Ravindran, professor of Reinforcement Learning at the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras and head of the school’s Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, to a noisy arcade at a converted airport hangar just north of Edmonton. In between Atari battles, we discussed why games are a crucial way to learn how to solve much bigger, more complex problems, the pros and cons of scalar rewards, and the natural link between RL and deep learning.</p>

<p>Addressing the event, S. Kris Gopalakrishnan, Chairman of itihaasa Research and Digital and Axilor Ventures, said, "Artificial Intelligence is an important technology driving global economic growth in the 4th industrial revolution and in which India should develop national capability and global leadership. This is essential to meet our aspirations of becoming a USD 5 trillion economy in the next five years. At itihaasa Research and Digital, we published the first-of-its-kind report on the landscape of AI research in India that sets the agenda for how we can build a strong capability in AI. </p><br>
<p>Delivering the inaugural address, Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi, Director, IIT Madras, said, “There is a lot of excitement surrounding AI and it is our job in the university to figure out the way forward in such a way that its benefits and potential for misuse are clear. We should not discover security issues too late, as was the case with Internet.”<br>
