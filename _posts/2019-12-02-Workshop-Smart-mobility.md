<p align="justify"> Transportation, particularly within cities, has undergone an immense transformation over the past decade. Availability of accurate real-time information and the emergence of transportation network companies have redefined how we plan, optimize, and manage our daily travel. The coming decade could completely reshape urban transport. Emerging technologies with 2-3 letter abbreviations - 5G, IoT, EV, AV, TNC - have the potential to disrupt urban mobility as we have known it for the past century. </p><br>

<p align="justify"> A key factor behind the disruption is also the emergence of Big Data and ML algorithms that can leverage the above technologies and deliver value to commuters. Data-driven models and algorithms are the fuel that drives the technologically advanced smart mobility of the future. While the widespread use of these technologies may be a decade away, the timeline could shift earlier or later based on the pace of advance in data-driven models and algorithms for mobility. Just as vehicles sans fuels will not run on the roads, TNCs, EVs, and AVs sans data-driven models and algorithms will be a non-starter!</p><br>

<p align="justify">The overwhelming response to a recent <a href="https://tsas.acm.org/special_issue.cfm">call for papers</a> for a special issue of ACM Transactions on Spatial Algorithms and Systems on Special issue on Urban Mobility: Algorithms and Systems motivated us to think of hosting a larger workshop to provide a broader and more interactive platform for the outstanding research happening in this area worldwide. In this workshop, we want to invite all stakeholders to come together and share, debate, and deliberate multiple viewpoints that will shape future smart mobility. We welcome students, data scientists, ML experts, transportation engineers, urban planners, and social scientists working in the industry, academia, or government agencies to participate in the workshop. </p><br>

<p align="justify"> The workshop will include a series of invited talks, invited presentations in thematic sessions,
tutorials, panel discussions, and poster presentations on state-of-the-art and -practice, running as a single track, that will provide an opportunity for all to listen and discuss in a single room.</p><br>

<strong><p align="justify">Tentative topics and sessions would include:</p></strong><br>

<p align="justify">

*Big Data in Mobility <br>
*ML algorithms for transportation<br>
*Sharing economy / Mobility as a service <br>
