abstract: The primary problem we will explore is that of semantic segmentation of images and videos using deep learning and attention models, with the aim of doing motion prediction.Use of attention has several advantages - it reduces the computation overhead both during training and testing; it reduced the number of parameters required to predict the output for each input so that learning can happen with fewer samples; it is a biologically and cognitively appealing technique. Attention techniques have been deployed widely with architectures such as CNNs, LSTMs, and memory networks. But this has been largely in the domain of images and text.
